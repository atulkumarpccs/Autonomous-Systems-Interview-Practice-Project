## General 
Question1 :Explain a recent project you've worked on. Why did you choose this project? 
What difficulties did you run into this project that you did not expect, and how did you solve them?

Answer: I have workded on game to system project expension working with Aristocrate for NSW extesion/adaption.
This project is choose as the latest project with my current employer for the same.

Strict timeline, first developement in sydney centre ,No document, Large code base need to update/extend adapt as especification.

Add document from code base by doxygen, resloving issue day by day with help of simulator for diffrent event, message by adding c++ code for the protocol.

## Mandatory 
Question 2 :What are some of the advantages & disadvantages of cameras, lidar and radar? What combination of these (and other sensors) would you use to ensure appropriate and accurate perception of the environment?

Question 3 :Describe the overall process of how a basic Kalman Filter works. Where might a basic Kalman Filter be less than sufficient? How can you improve the basic algorithm to improve performance in such a situation?

Question 4 :How does an Extended Kalman Filter differ from a regular Kalman Filter? Provide an example of where an EKF would be necessary or an improvement, and detail why it would be needed in that situation.

Question 5 :What is the difference between an Extended Kalman Filter and an Unscented Kalman Filter? In what situations would there be larger differences between the two approaches?

## Coding
